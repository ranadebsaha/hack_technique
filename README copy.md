# Project Title: **Affordable & Secure Doorstep Digital Assistance for Students**

---

## Project Description  

In many **rural and semi-urban areas**, students who have completed their **10th or 12th standard** face significant challenges in accessing and filling out essential **online forms**, such as:

- College admission applications  
- Scholarship applications  
- Competitive entrance exam registrations  
- Job applications  
- Government scheme enrollments  

These challenges arise due to:

- Limited digital literacy  
- Lack of access to smartphones, laptops, or internet connectivity  
- Cyber cafés being located far away (2-3 km or more)  
- Misinformation, overcharging, or scams at cyber cafés  

As a result, many students either make mistakes, miss important deadlines, or fall victim to fraudulent practices.

## Our Solution  

We offer a **community-driven web and mobile platform** that enables students to request **doorstep digital assistance** for various tasks related to education and government services.

### How it works:

1. **Request Support:**  
   Students or their parents can raise a help request via the mobile app or website.

2. **Expert Assignment:**  
   A **digitally skilled local student** is assigned as an expert to visit the student's home and provide help with the required task.

3. **Form-Filling & Guidance:**  
   The expert helps in filling out forms, making payments (if required), tracking application status, and offering career or college guidance.

4. **Feedback & Transparency:**  
   After completion, users can rate the service and view a full summary of the assistance provided.
